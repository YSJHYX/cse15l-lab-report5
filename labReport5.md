## Student Post

Hi, I want to ask a question about this week's homework. I have finished it, but when I ran the `test.sh`, I found the output result was wrong: it didn't correctly print the length of my input `StudentTest`, the length should be 11. Can you help me check if I made any mistakes in my code? Thanks! Below is my code and the screenshot of the incorrect output.

```
class numCount {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = args[0];
        System.out.println("The length of the input is : " + input.length());
    }
}
```
